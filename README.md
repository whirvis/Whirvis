# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋
Hi! I'm Whirvis. I'm the creator of Ardenus Studios, Whirvex Software, as well
as JRakNet! At the moment, I'm currently working on a myriad of projects. This
includes:

### Ardenus Studios
 - The Ardenus Engine
 - The Ardenus Vapora
 - Five Nights at Freddy's 3 DX

### Whirvex Software
 - Whirvex Args
 - Whirvex Command
 - Whirvex Event

# Collaboration/Contact
I'm open to collaborate with anyone who would like to collaborate with me!
Futhermore, if you are interested in working on any of these projects, give me
a quick shout at ``whirvis@ardenus.org``. I'd love to welcome some new members
to a team! I can be reached on Discord as well at ``Whirvis#0001``. I'm actually
online quite often over there! I don't mind pings from strangers, so long as
they aren't spam ;)
