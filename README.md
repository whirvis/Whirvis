I'm open to collaborate with anyone who would like to collaborate with me!
If you are interested in working on any of these projects, give me a quick
shout at <a href="mailto:swhirvis@ardenus.org">whirvis@ardenus.org</a>. I'd
love to form a team for these organization! I can be reached on Discord as
well at ``Whirvis#0001``. I'm actually online quite often over there! I don't
mind pings from strangers, so long as they aren't spam ;)
